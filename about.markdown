Senior Java Developer / Cyber security Researcher 

"Jack of all trades !" 

I am a self-taught Bug Bounty Hunter /Cyber Security Enthusiast  with a passion for programming and a penchant for learning new technologies. I have been a reliable team-player who envisages and develops production-worthy systems and applications for my clients. 

After 8 years of being an ardent programmer(JAVA ) , I switched gears to cyber security and became a Bug Bounty Hunter. I have experience working on  pentesting labs such as Hackthebox, OSCP labs, Pentesterlab, Tryhackme, Virtualhackinglabs etc. 

I am excited to leverage my cross-domain knowledge and experience to resolve interesting problems.
